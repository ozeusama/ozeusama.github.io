      <div class="comment">The only place you can save is in your room. Because it takes time to get there, (15 minutes just to go from the dorm entrance to your room), I'll only be saving once a day. This makes it so I can't "cheat" by saving before each choice to see what the best answer is. I'll try not to just pick the safest choices to keep things exciting.</div>
